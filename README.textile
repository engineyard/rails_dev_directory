h2. Bootstrapping

To get set up, first up, create your MySQL database:

<pre><code>rake db:create</code></pre>

Then run the bootstrap task:

<pre><code>rake bootstrap</code></pre>

The bootstrap task will ask you for a username and password for a regular user that will have ownership of the provider that is created, as well as another user that will have admin rights.

You'll also need to create a site_config.yml file in the config/ dir. You can start with the example:

<pre><code>cp config/site_config.yml.example config/site_config.yml</code></pre>

h2. Running the unit tests

Create the test database...

<pre><code>rake testing db:create</code></pre>

... and populate it:

<pre><code>rake db:test:clone</code></pre>

Run the tests:

<pre><code>rake spec</code></pre>

or using ZenTest

<pre><code>autospec</code></pre>

h2. Running the cucumber acceptance tests

<pre><code>cucumber features</code></pre>

or add them to your ZenTests:

<pre><code>AUTOFEATURE=true autospec</code></pre>
